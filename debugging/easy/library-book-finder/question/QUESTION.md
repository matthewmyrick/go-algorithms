# Library Book Finder 📚🔍 [DEBUG ME!]

The library's digital catalog system is broken! Patrons can't find books properly, search results are wrong, and the checkout system is malfunctioning.

## The Problem

The library system should:
1. Allow patrons to search for books by title, author, or ISBN
2. Show accurate book availability status
3. Handle book checkouts and returns correctly
4. Track due dates and calculate overdue fees
5. Display search results in a readable format

But librarians are getting complaints about incorrect search results and checkout errors!

## Expected Behavior

```
Search for "Harry Potter":
- Should find all Harry Potter books
- Show availability status correctly
- Allow checkout of available books

Checkout System:
- Book checked out should show as unavailable
- Due date should be 14 days from checkout
- Overdue fees: $0.25 per day after due date
```

## Your Task

Find and fix ALL the bugs in the library system. The code has multiple issues with:
- String searching and comparison
- Book availability tracking
- Date calculations for due dates
- Overdue fee calculations
- Data structure operations

Help the librarians get their system back in order! 📖✨
