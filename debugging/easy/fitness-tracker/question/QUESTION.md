# Fitness Tracker 🏃‍♂️📱 [DEBUG ME!]

Your fitness app is giving users incorrect workout statistics! The step counter, calorie calculator, and fitness goals tracker all have bugs that need fixing.

## The Problem

The fitness tracker should:
1. Accurately count steps and calculate distance
2. Calculate calories burned based on activity
3. Track progress towards daily fitness goals
4. Determine fitness level based on activity
5. Handle different user profiles correctly

But users are complaining about wrong calculations!

## Expected Behavior

```
User: 150 lbs, walked 10,000 steps
Expected distance: 5.0 miles (2000 steps = 1 mile)
Expected calories: 400 (4 calories per 100 steps for 150 lb person)

Daily Goal: 10,000 steps
Progress: 100% (goal achieved)
```

## Your Task

Find and fix ALL the bugs in the fitness tracking calculations. The code has multiple issues with:
- Step-to-distance conversion
- Calorie calculation formulas
- Goal progress tracking
- Activity level classification
- User weight handling

Get those fitness enthusiasts back on track! 💪✨
